title: About me.
---
    I like to program. I also like business. Together, I like business oriented software development. A splash or two of machine learning or computer vision have their place in my heart, but my career aspirations are much more along the lines of how software and computing can streamline a business.

    Not coincidentally, I like stuff that works. Systems that all play well together. It's what drives me and largely determines my interests. Cars, for example, are amazing machines and something I have a modest passion for.

    As of writing this, I don't know what else to put on an about page. This is my first iteration of my website and I'm mostly trying to get pages in paths to prevent 404's. I'll go ahead and call it here.
