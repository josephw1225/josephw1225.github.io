I've been following a [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/). So far, pretty dang easy. I intend to use this website in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/) as my own personal solution to this online portfolio and website hosting business. I plan to keep my resume here and have a small blog to recap and analyze any reading I may do.

Wow this is easy though. I don't plan to make it much more complicated either. This website needs to load blazingly fast and be simple.
